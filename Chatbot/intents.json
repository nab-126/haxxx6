See the withdrawal/cancellation page on the Office of the Registrar’s website to determine the prorated fee amounts. NOTE: the health insurance fee, Class Pass fee, and the Document fee (new students only) are non-refundable and will remain charged at 100% for all withdrawals.\n\nPlease allow 4-5 weeks from the effective date of your withdrawal for us to determine if you are due a refund.

Please note, a UHS late fee on your Cal Central bill is different than a SHIP late waiver fee. Refer to CalCentral to view an itemized list of all your fees. If you have additional questions, please contact us. For SHIP waiver questions, please contact the SHIP Office at ship@berkeley.edu or 510-642-5700.\n \nWhat if I am still awaiting a decision regarding my SHIP waiver? I have paid the premium in order to clear my account, but if my waiver is subsequently approved, when can I expect a refund?\u200B\nIf your waiver is ultimately approved, you may expect a refund within 30 days. If you have signed up for direct deposit, also known as Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), it will automatically post to your bank account. If you don’t have EFT, please sign up now to expedite the refund process. If you have not signed up for EFT, a paper check will be issued that can be picked up at Cal Student Central. Be sure to pick up your check within 10 days of it being issued or it will be sent to your local address. Please update your address in CalCentral so your check is mailed to the correct location.\n \nDoes my Financial Aid cover the cost of SHIP?\nAs part of the waiver decision making process, students should consider how maintaining and/or waiving out of SHIP can impact their financial aid offer.
